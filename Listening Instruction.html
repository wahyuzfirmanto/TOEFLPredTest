            <h2>Part A</h2>
            <p> 
                Directions: Each item in this part consists of a brief conversation involving two speakers. Following each conversation, a third voice will ask a question. You will hear the conversations and questions only once, and they will not be written out.

When you have heard each conversation and question, read the four answer choices and select the one-(A), (B), (C), or (D)-that best answers the question based on what is directly stated or on what can be inferred. Then fill in the space on your answer sheet that matches the letter of the answer that you have selected.
Here is an example.  
            </p>

      
            <p>Click this button:</p>
            <button  onclick="playInstruction()">
            <i class="fas fa-play" id="playIcon"></i>
            </button>
            
            <audio src="audio/Listening 1 Instruction.mp3" type="audio/mp3" id="audio">
                Your browser does not support the audio tag.
                     </audio> 
            
            <p> 
                You will read: 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>(A) Open the window.</li>
                <li>(B) Move the chair. (Correct Answer)</li>
                <li>(C) Leave the room.</li>
                <li>(D) Take a seat.</li>
            </ul>
<p> 
From the conversation you find out that the woman thinks the man should put the chair over by the window. The best answer to the question, "What does the woman think the man should do?" is (B), "Move the chair." You should fill in (B) on your answer sheet.
